Repository for CS4550, Web Development at Northeastern University

The class primarily used the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) for development.

Projects included a form builder app and another app that each student had to creatively think about, write a proposal for, and get approved.

After playing with a few ideas, I went with Roomr, an application to help you live better by managing the space around you. After signing up and logging in, users can create "rooms" for anywhere they work or live. Add "tasks", units of things to get done in your rooms, and let other's who also share this space help out. View your profile to see which rooms you belong to and which tasks you currently have assigned to you. Allow Roomr to help you get more things done in the space around you.
